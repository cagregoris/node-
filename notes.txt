- node is a runtime environment for executing Javascript code
- Asynchronous (aka non-blocking, handles lots of requests)
  - Continuously monitors the event queue
- Typically you wouldn't use node for the backend server because as you add more routes, it gets more complex
  - Instead, we use a famework called express
  - Express gives the application a clear structure to handle various routes
  - Express is built on top of http module in node
